# Boomer Prompt Pro v1.0

**Elevating AI Accessibility for the Modern Retiree**

## 🚀 Overview

Boomer Prompt Pro is a lightweight, frontend web application designed to bridge the gap between AI potential and user execution. By using the **RTF-C Framework** (Role, Task, Format, Context), this tool empowers users to generate professional-grade prompts for LLMs like ChatGPT without technical friction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Structure:** HTML5
- **Styling:** Bootstrap 5 (Responsive Design)
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Algorithm:** Linear String Concatenation Engine

## 🧠 Technical Logic: The Concatenation Algorithm

The core of this application is a custom JavaScript function that performs a **Data Transformation** task:

1. It captures user-input strings from four distinct DOM elements.
2. It validates the presence of data to ensure prompt quality.
3. It performs a structured concatenation, injecting the inputs into a proven prompt-engineering template.
4. It outputs the final string back to the DOM for user retrieval.

## 🛤️ v2.0 Roadmap

- **Local Persistence:** Use `localStorage` to save favorite prompts.
- **Category Templates:** Dropdown menus for "Finance," "Health," and "Writing."
- **Dark Mode:** Enhanced accessibility for low-light usage.
